## Features

### Interactive Map

The application features an interactive map that displays earthquake locations using intuitive visual cues. Earthquakes are represented as circles on the map, with different colors indicating their magnitudes. Users can click on these circles to access additional information about specific earthquakes.

### Date Range Filtering

Earthquake Tracker allows users to narrow down earthquake data by specifying a start date and an end date. This filtering capability ensures that users can focus on earthquakes that occurred within their desired time frame.

### Earthquake Listing

Below the map, a comprehensive list of earthquakes meeting the specified date criteria is provided. This list includes essential details about each earthquake, such as its location, magnitude, and the date it occurred. Users can quickly scan this list for specific earthquake information.

### Statistical Information

For users interested in broader insights, the "Estadísticas" (Statistics) section offers valuable statistical information. It displays the total number of earthquakes that occurred within the specified date range and calculates the average magnitude of those earthquakes.

## Usage

1. **Specify Date Range**: To begin, use the "Fecha de inicio" (Start date) and "Fecha de finalización" (End date) input fields to define the time range you want to investigate. This allows you to focus on a specific period of earthquake activity.

2. **Retrieve Earthquake Data**: After entering your desired date range, click the "Mostrar" (Show) button. Earthquake Tracker will fetch earthquake data based on your date criteria and update the map and earthquake list accordingly.

3. **Explore the Map**: The map will display earthquake locations as circles, with different colors representing the magnitudes. Clicking on these circles will provide detailed information about individual earthquakes.

4. **Review Earthquake List**: Below the map, you can explore a comprehensive list of earthquakes that match your specified date range. This list includes key details about each earthquake.

5. **Check Statistics**: In the "Estadísticas" (Statistics) section, you will find valuable insights, such as the total number of earthquakes within your selected date range and the average magnitude of those earthquakes.
